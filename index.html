<p style="margin-left: 300;margin-right: 300">I implemented several techniques to bring the harmony between the teams. Started with brainstrorming with many crucial stakeholders and getting to know about them and their perscpective about the project. Circulated surveys and conducted interviews to grasp more about business objctive from everyones perspective.
